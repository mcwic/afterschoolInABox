## Week 3 - More Scratch and an Introduction to Cryptology
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week will involve students designing and beginning to execute a big project in Scratch. 

We will also introduce students to the Pigpen Cipher and the concept of encoding and decoding messages.

--- 

Time: 5-10 minutes

1. Ask the students if they worked on any projects while they were at home, if they did, allow them to present their work to the class. 

---

Time: 7 minutes

Explain the Pigpen Cipher (use <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/pigpencipher.html">this</a> page if you need help & to print out or display the cipher key) to students. Show them how to encode and decode two simple messages, <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/pigpencipher.html#example">for example</a>, "hello" and "goodbye".

The Pigpen Cipher Game:

Time: 7 minutes

Explain to students the following game:
<ol>
<li>You are going to sit in a line. </li>
<li>The right-most person in line will be given a message that is written in English, this person will encode the message to pigpen and pass the message to the person on their left.</li><li> The person on the left (person 2) will decode the message to English, and pass the message to the person on their left (person 3).</li> <li>Person 3 will encode the message to pigpen and pass the pigpen message to the person on their left (person 4). So on and so forth.</li><li> At the end of the line, we will determine whether the decoded message is what we originally sent!</li></ol> [To prevent boredom of those students waiting for a message, you may want to send a message from each end of the line on different colored paper.]

Time: 40-45 minutes

1. Work with each student to establish a plan for a "big project" give examples such as a short scene from a movie, the flappy bird game, the Pong game, the Space Invaders Game, etc. Walk students through what the different parts of their program might need to be, (e.g. for Pong: moving paddles, a bouncing ball, a scoring system). Links to example "solutions" for the projects listed are below:
2. If multiple students are interested in creating the same types of programs, you may want to group them together in the classroom so that they can ask each other for help.
3. Allow students to work on their big projects and tell them that you will be continuing work next week and will be presenting progress projects at the end of next class, but tell them they are definitely free to work on their own. Consider inviting special guests for the project presentations such as parents or another teacher or other students. You may also wish to offer gifts to each of the presenters (e.g. plastic sunglasses, or some other trinket). Further, you may wish to allow two weeks or class periods for students to work on projects depending on the size of your class and the interest level of the students.
