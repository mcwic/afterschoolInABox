## Week 1 - The Beginning: An Introduction to Scratch & Computer Scientists
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week, start by introducing yourself and the field of computer science. If you are not a computer scientist, consider displaying one or two of the videos from the <a href="http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/computerscientistlibrary.html">computer scientist library</a>.

Then, get your students excited about programming by getting them started with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch programming</a>.

## Week 1 (continued) - Introductions (Role Modeling)

Time: 5 minutes

Introduce yourself. If you are a computer scientist, tell students how you got into computer science, why you like it, and a little bit about your other interests.

TIPS:
1. Avoid statements such as "I was good at math and science so I knew that computer science would be right for me." Stating that you were "good" at math and science implies that your ability was an intrinsic property rather than something you developed through practice and hard work. (Girls often feel that their abilities are implicit rather than something they can gain with through practice. <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/betterapproachestowellintentionedbutharmfulmessages_overcomingstereotypethreatimproveretention.pdf">Learn More</a>). 

2. Try to provide relatable interests (ice skating, soccer, etc.) so that the students can see themselves in your shoes one day.

3. If possible, try to describe multiple careers and eductional paths available in computer science (try our mentor library to find short (<2min) videos and stories about different types of computer scientists). Be sure to let the students know that computer science is valuable in all professions such as medicine, law, and journalism.

## Week 1 (continued) - Introduction to Scratch

Total Time: 55 minutes

1. Introduce students to the Scratch platform. Direct them to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu>scratch.mit.edu</a> and have them create an account.
2. Show them how to use Scratch by doing a quick example. Have a sprite move 10 units to the left. [Example code](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21655719/)
3. Show the concept of a loop by repeatedly pressing the green flag. Now, show them how using an infinite loop leads to the same result. [Example code](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656115/)
4. Allow the students free time to create and explore the Scratch interface. If you have students who are more reticent, provide them with goal projects such as those listed on the next slide.

## Week 1 (continued) - Potential Goal Projects
1. Have the sprite move around the screen visiting each corner of the screen and changing colors when it reaches a corner. [Example of this project.](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656210/)
2. Have the sprite follow the mouse. [Example of this project.](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/21656523/)
3. Many [additional projects](http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/?date=this_month) are available on the Scratch website with source code visible.
