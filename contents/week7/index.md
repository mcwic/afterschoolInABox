## Weeks 7 & 8 - Tumblr & Creating a Programming Portfolio
Students can apply their HTML and CSS learning by programming in Tumblr.

Walk your students through the Tumblr tutorial located [here](http://mcwic.github.io/tumblrtutorial/).

It will probably take two classes to work through this material. 

In week 7, we recommend walking through items 1-5. In week 8 we recommend working through items 6-9. Alternately, you can help your students create a programming portfolio in Tumblr during week 8, and leave items 6-9 for the students to work through on their own. 

Instructions on creating a programming portfolio in Tumblr are located [here]().
If you choose to have students create their own programming portfolio, you may also want to do the "Create Your Own Computer Scientist Profile" activity with them. Instructions and templates for this activity are available in the "Computer Scientist Library Projects & Assessments" section [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/teacher_resources.html#top).
