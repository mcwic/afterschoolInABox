## Week 2 - More Scratch & More Computer Scientists
Total Time: 60 mintues

This week will involve teaching students about conditionals in Scratch and gaining more exposure to "real" computer scientists from the computer scientist library.

--- 

Time: 5-10 minutes

0. Ask the students if they worked on any Scratch projects while they were at home, if they did, allow them to present their work to the class. 

Time: 5-10 minutes

1. This week, have students complete the "they're like me!" Computer Scientist Library scavenger hunt available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlblocks/teacher_resources.html#top) under Computer Scientist Library Projects & Assessments.

Time: 5 minutes

1. Place students in pairs, try to pair students at a similar level together, or in the case of a class with mixed ages, one student from each age group. Tell the pair that they must ask each other for help before asking you. Alternately, you can implement the "two before me" rule: require that students ask two classmates for help before approaching you.

Time: 5-10 minutes

1. The goal project for this week is creating sprites that chase each other and creating a playable piano. In order to complete these projects, students will need to understand conditional statements. 
2. One possible explaination of a conditional statement: "If it is raining outside, I need my umbrella, else, I do not need an umbrella."
3. Show students a Scratch based conditional statement example, such as one that "if the mousepointer is touching the sprite, the sprite is red, else the sprite is blue." State this sentance and then show the equivalent Scratch code.
4. Expect to need to re-explain conditionals to certain students one-on-one.

Time: 25-35 minutes

1. For students who are self driven: allow the open ended option to create "sprites that chase each other" and a "playable piano". For students who require more guidance, please see detailed goal project descriptions on the next slide.
2. At the end of the day, encourage students to work on Scratch projects on their own, let them know that they will be able to present in front of the class next time! (Consider having small prizes for those who do outside projects.)

Potential Goal Projects:
1. Ask students to create a <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2425970/">scratch piano</a>. For students that finish early, urge them to create a drum kit, trombone, and other instruments. 
2. Ask students to create "game" in which the cat follows the mouse and the dog chases after the cat, see our example <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20478118/">here</a>. Challenge students to turn this into a game by keeping score for every time the cat and dog collide. <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/programming/scratch/scratch_home.htm">Idea credit.</a>
3. See <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/programming/scratch/scratch_home.htm">here</a> for more scratch project ideas.
