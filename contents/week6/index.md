## Week 6 - Reviewing HTML, learning CSS, and Creating webpages outside of w3
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week students will review HTML and create more complex webpages.

---

Time: 10 minutes

1. Ask students about what they remember about HTML; if any students worked on html projects over the week, ask them to show their project to the class.

2. Have students write HTML code on the board (example script available <a href="">here</a>). If students make mistakes on the board, tell them where there is a bug. See if they can figure out and fix the bug without you telling them the specific error.

Time: 10 minutes

1. Show students the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXLIfufwmsE&list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt&index=7) for creating lists in HTML and the collection of [CSS videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAChkbDdt4w&list=PLPpkJJSKXEJ11Mq8xjty3AZKldH9V48mt&index=8).

2. Give them each a sheet of paper (or ask them to come up to the whiteboard) and ask them to write the code they think they need to create a website with a purple heading and a blue background.

Time: 40 minutes

1. The students will now move on to working on a goal project. (have them do this not on w3, but rather on their own text editor [click for more information](http://mcwic.github.io/htmltutorial/contents/start/)). 

2. Use goal projects 2 through 2c available [here](http://mcwic.github.io/htmlBuildingBlocks.html)
