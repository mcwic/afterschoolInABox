## Week 4 - Final Scratch Presentations & An Introduction to the Internet
Total Time: 60 minutes

This week will be students' chance to present their "big" scratch projects that they worked on at the last 1-2 sessions. Try to bring in parents or fun rewards (cupcakes, sunglasses, magnets, etc.) for the presentations.

At the end of the session, students will watch a short introduction to the internet video and introduce the concept of HTML.

Allow each student to come up to the projector and present their project. If you do not have access to a projector, have students gather around each other's computers.
